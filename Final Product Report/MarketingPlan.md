_Who is likely to use/buy this product. What demographic?_

The main target audience (Customer) will be the Education Committee of the CSEE department (University of Essex). This is the main customer for our product as our product has been constructed for the data analytics of student marks and exam scores. Another possible customer could be Secondary / Primary school teachers who could also use the product as they could input a similar dataset.

The EC&#39;s (Education Committee) main needs from the product is that it should help analyse student&#39;s marks from previous years so that they may use it in consideration when planning and fine-tuning modules. The customer has stated that they are open to any future product features that improve the overall usability and quality of life from the product. This could possibly include the product producing informed analysis regarding the modules but also could range into things such as a friendly GUI.

We can satisfy these needs by following an agile product development cycle. This will be completed by first creating a product that meets all of the customer&#39;s functional requirements. This will be communicated to the customer, upon this point which we can expand and begin to develop the extra features which could normally fall under the non-functional requirements.

# Economics

- What is the total size of your market?

Currently the size of our target market is number of staff within the Education Committee of the CSEE, however after product development we can expand our target market to every CSEE department in every UK university (Currently 111~ universities who offer computer science[1]).

- What percent share of the market will you have?

As there are 111~ universities who offer computer science in the UK and we are providing a product to one university, our market share will be 0.009% (or 1/111). Due to releasing our product with only the EC within the CSEE department, our market share would be very small.

#
# Competition

- Which other products are on the market, and what advantages can you offer over them?

The advantage over other products on the market right now is that we offer personalised support for each customer which is dedicated to them. As the main product that they use now is produced on a mass scale, it would normally take a few business days in order to get technical support. In which case it may not even resolve the issue.

# Product, Price, Promotion, Place

- Describe how the 4Ps apply to your product - Product, Place, Promotion, Price, and what you can do/have done to enhance these aspects.

Product – Our product is an intangible service which satiates the needs of the EC within the CSEE department. It does this by taking an input of student marks, and the compiles the input into user friendly tables which allow for the sorting and compilation of data, It can also compute graphical data which will help the EC analyse marks so that they can help plan future modules.

Place- As our product is a digital service, it cannot be physically placed into a location. As such the placing of our product will be digitally so that it is easily accessed by customers. This can be achieved by placement in a cloud location that allows access to our product from any physical location as long as there is a valid and established connection to the web.

Promotion – As our product is aimed for university staff it has to be promoted through specific channels. This will be through Email Marketing and Facebook targeted ads. By Email Marketing we can promote our product as we can directly communicate with staff at different universities, as they will be our target market this technique will bring back direct results and notify us if our product is wanted or not. Through Facebook targeted ad&#39;s we can set the target market to staff of certain university pages on Facebook. However this technique may not be as successful as Email Marketing as it is not directly interacting with the customer. As we do not know the exact cost per lead on Facebook Ads, we would have to adjust the price accordingly. We could set aside £3000 budget for ads, if we were to get 300 clicks this would equate to £10 per lead [2].

Price – If we follow the rules of the pricing mechanism in economics [3], we as a supplier can set the price to a figure that we find reasonable as we have a demand from the EC of the CSEE department. As such we have decided that £30000 is a reasonable figure to charge a customer per year.

# Sales Forecast

- How many downloads / sales / shipped units could you realistically achieve in the first 12 months?

Realistically without any proper market analysis, our product already has one guaranteed customer; The EC of CSEE. However with optimistic figures we could possibly gain a new academic institution every month. This could leave us with an end figure of £360,000
