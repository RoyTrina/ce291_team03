[Customer Satisfaction](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T1903-27)
The basic foundation of the program is to input and analyse the data and use them 
for interpretations, modifications etc. Meeting with the client ensures that the 
team will receive proper feedback about what they are lacking in, adequate in, 
and any new requirements made by the supervisor. The client should be able to see,
try and debug the code to test the productivity of the project. The demonstration 
should be straight to the point and informing the client about the details behind 
the project. The team should explain what they have missing, what they are working 
on, and what they have completed. The user stories on Jira should be compatible 
with the progress that the team has made.
